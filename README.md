Does a node, by any other name, make more sense to a lay-person?

- __node__: a point at which lines or pathways intersect or branch; a central or connecting point
- __item__: an individual article or unit, especially one that is part of a list, collection, or
  set
- __thing__:
    - an object that one need not, cannot, or does not wish to give a specific name to.
    - *an action, activity, event, thought, or utterance*
    - used euphemistically to refer to a man's penis.
- __object__: a material thing that can be seen and touched

"Thing" may be a winner.
